This tarball contains two main programs:
-parsernoopt: Simple classification program without any optimization and without support for the classification of traffic encapsulated with SSL.
-parser: Main classification program. The usage is the following:

	Usage: ./parser [OPTIONS] [FILE]
	-h	Help (this message)
	-P	Do not label connections, simply output sizes of the first packet
	-L	Label connections (default)
	-D	Use DOMINANT labeling heuristic
	-C	Use CLUSTER+PORT labeling heuristic (default)
	-S	Analyze encapsulated SSL traffic (default: no SSL parsing)
	-m <M>	Memory optimization (O: none (default), 1:removed classed connections, 2: 1+Garbage Collection)
	-t <f>	Apply threshold -<f> for assignment heuristic (default: 255, no threshold)
	-p <n>	Print sizes of first <n> application packets (only valid with -P option)

These classifiers rely on models given in the files model.c and model.h. This tarball contains a model based on the sizes of the first three packets, for the following applications:
	bittorent
	edonkey
	ftp
	http
	msn
	nntp
	pop3
	smtp
	ssh
	ssl

To generate new models for your applications, please use the function printmodel from the Matlab library at http://www-rp.lip6.fr/~bernaill/earlyclassif.html.
